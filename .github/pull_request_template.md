## What this changes

<!-- One or two sentences. Link the issue if there is one. -->

## Why

<!-- The problem it solves. Skip if obvious from the title. -->

## Checklist

- [ ] `cargo check` succeeds
- [ ] `cargo test` passes
- [ ] I tested the real loop: held Ctrl+Win, spoke, released, and the text landed at the cursor
- [ ] No new network destinations. Privacy is the product: the app may only
      reach the user's configured cleanup provider and the update endpoints.
      If this PR adds a host, say so explicitly here and expect a discussion.
- [ ] No em dashes in code, comments, docs, or user-facing strings
- [ ] Settings, README, or the site are updated if behavior changed
- [ ] Clippy is clean (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)

## Anything reviewers should know

<!-- Trade-offs, follow-ups, things you were unsure about. -->
